#This is the repository where we will host implementations of some of optimization algorithms/methods. Below are some of the materials to be covered:
-- Discrete optimizaton
-- Continous optimization: Direct methods, Iterative methods (Newtton-based methods, BGFS, Projeced gradient , etc)
--- Eign values problems and Algorithm: Jacobi method, QR, Power/Inverse Power method
--- Dynamic programmic for optimization (-- see Hamdi A. Taha, Operational Researc)
